# Route-planning
In this project, you will demonstrate your understanding of dynamic memory and linked data structures, and extend your skills in terms of program design, testing, and debugging. You will also learn about route planning, and implement a simple route re-planning mechanism.
Stage 0 – Reading and Analyzing Input Data//
The first version of the program read the input from stdin and print out some basic information. The code also ensure that the supplied route is valid, i.e., it starts in the initial cell, ends in the goal cell, consists of legal moves (one cell moves and no diagonal moves) and does not visit a cell with a block.
Stage 1 – Drawing and Replanning 
Extend the program to visualize the input grid and route, attempt repair of a broken route, and visualize the repaired route. All of the Stage 0 output should be retained.
